I have one printhead with a Dual Extruder installed in my printer.
So there is ONE X-carier with 2 seperait direct drive extruders each with a stepperdriver, steppermoter, hotend & nozzle.

This is what it looks like:
       ----------------------
       |                    |
       |    N     P     N   |   N = Nozzle     P = Probe (BLTouch)
       |                    |
       ----------------------
So the printhead is ONE unit with 2 printheads & a BLTouch sandwiched together.

I don't see this setup nowhere in Marlin 2.1.1.

In Marlin i can only configure this:

- Dual extruder that uses a single stepper motor
- A dual-nozzle that uses a servomotor to raise/lower one (or both) of the nozzles
- Two separate X-carriages with extruders that connect to a moving part
- via a solenoid docking mechanism. Requires SOL1_PIN and SOL2_PIN.
- Switching Toolhead, such as E3D Tool Changer.
- Magnetic Switching Toolhead. Support swappable and dockable toolheads with a magnetic docking mechanism using movement and no servo.
- Electromagnetic Switching Toolhead.
- Mixing Extruder. 2 filements in one hotend.

Question 1:
How do i configure Marlin with a single X-carier with 2 seperait printheads?

Question 2:
How do you set the Probe (BLTouch) to Nozzle offset when you have 2 nozzle's? ( #define NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET { xx, yy, zz } )?
If you set the distance from the left nozzle to the probe, what happens to nozzle 2?

Can someone give me some instructions?

Thank you
